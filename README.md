#### **Slide 2: Project Proposal Updates**
**Question**: *What changes have you made to your project proposal in light of your progress so far and your supervisor and committee feedback?*

- **Changes Made**:
  - **Shift from ChatGPT to Custom Models**: Originally planned to use ChatGPT for key functionalities; changed to building custom AI models.
  - **Custom Model Prioritization**: Developed a priority list for model creation:
    - **1. Question Generation Model**
    - **2. CV Analysis Model**
    - **3. Semantic Similarity Model**
    - **4. Voice-to-Text**
    - **5. Text-to-Voice**

- **Reasons & Improvements**:
  - **Increased Customization**: Custom models tailored to the project allow more relevant and adaptive features, such as personalized questions and accurate feedback.
  - **Enhanced Realism**: Voice models enhance the simulation’s lifelike qualities, providing a more immersive experience for users.
  - **Direct Alignment with Project Goals**: By developing these specific models, we can better meet the simulator’s objectives.

#### **Slide 3: Methods to Find Information**
**Question**: *Compare critically two approaches you have used to get information, look at strengths and weaknesses, and indicate the most effective approach for the project.*

- **1. Literature Review and Research**
  - **Strengths**: Provides a strong theoretical foundation, identifying best practices in VR and interview simulations.
  - **Weaknesses**: Mostly theoretical and time-intensive, with limited direct application to our project specifics.
  - **Effectiveness**: Valuable for understanding industry standards and guiding initial project goals.

- **2. Team Brainstorming**
  - **Strengths**: Encourages creative solutions, real-time idea evaluation, and prioritization based on feasibility.
  - **Weaknesses**: Risk of groupthink, overwhelming number of ideas can blur project scope.
  - **Effectiveness**: Highly effective in translating high-level concepts into specific requirements, leading to practical project direction.

- **Most Effective Approach**: **Team Brainstorming** provided actionable ideas and prioritized tasks, directly advancing our development process.

#### **Slide 4: Skills Needed for Project Success**
**Question**: *What skills do you need?*

- **Main Skills Required**:
  - **VR Development (Unity)**: Needed to create an immersive, interactive VR environment.
  - **AI/ML Model Development**: Custom models are critical for personalized question generation and CV analysis.
  - **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Essential for handling voice-to-text and text-to-voice interactions.

- **Three Skills to Develop**:
  - **1. Custom Model Development in AI/ML**
    - **Reason**: Allows tailored features such as question generation and response evaluation.
    - **Plan**: Complete online courses, experiment with AI frameworks (e.g., PyTorch).

  - **2. Voice Processing (Voice-to-Text, Text-to-Voice)**
    - **Reason**: Realistic voice interactions are essential for candidate immersion.
    - **Plan**: Use open-source libraries (e.g., DeepSpeech) and fine-tune for interview vocabularies.

  - **3. VR Interaction Design in Unity**
    - **Reason**: Improved VR realism and candidate engagement.
    - **Plan**: Advanced Unity courses, small VR projects to refine skills in interaction and event handling.

#### **Slide 5: Planned Work in the Near Future**
**Question**: *What work do you intend to carry out in the near future?*

- **Work Priorities**:
  - **1. Develop the Question Generation Model**
    - **Justification**: Central to the simulator’s functionality; ensures personalized interview questions.
    - **Timeline**: To be completed within the first two weeks.

  - **2. Implement the CV Analysis Model**
    - **Justification**: Supports question generation by providing relevant candidate information.
    - **Timeline**: Scheduled immediately after question generation; completion expected in the following two weeks.

  - **3. Prototype and Enhance VR Environment in Unity**
    - **Justification**: Essential for creating a realistic simulation; early completion allows for testing and user feedback.
    - **Timeline**: Ongoing development, with key components ready by end of first phase.

  - **4. Initial UI Development for Candidate Interaction**
    - **Justification**: Enables candidate access to the simulator, upload CVs, and start sessions.
    - **Timeline**: Start in first phase, refine through iterative testing.

- **Link to Schedule**: Each priority aligns with the initial project phase to complete core functionalities, ensuring we meet upcoming deadlines.
