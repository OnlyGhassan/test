## Weekly Activities

### Week 1

**Sunday: Objectives**

- **To determine if a session is recorded or not.**
- **To establish a reliable method to link sessions and their corresponding recordings.**

**Problem Statement**

While working with the API of the university's learning system, we encountered difficulties in identifying which sessions were recorded. This impeded our ability to effectively manage and access session recordings.

**Challenges Faced**

- Identifying Recorded Sessions: The API did not directly provide a clear indication of whether a session was recorded.
- Linking Sessions and Recordings: There was no straightforward parameter or attribute linking sessions to their recordings, making it challenging to access or verify recorded content.

**Completed Tasks**

- **Step 1: Investigate API Data Parameters**
  - We began by thoroughly examining the API data provided for each session. Through this investigation, we identified a parameter called `Joined`.
- **Step 2: Understanding the 'Joined' Parameter**
  - Parameter Name: Joined
  - Type: Boolean
  - Purpose: Indicates if the session has been attended and, consequently, recorded.
- **Step 3: Solution Implementation**
  - We hypothesized that if `Joined` is true, the session was recorded. This hypothesis was tested and confirmed through several iterations and checks.

**Monday: Problem Statement**

In the context of a university's learning management system, we encountered a challenge in differentiating between students and teachers within session data retrieved via an API. The system needed to distinguish the roles of various attendees to ensure proper handling and analysis of session information. The API response did not explicitly categorize attendees as students or teachers, leading to ambiguity and the potential for incorrect data processing.

**Analysis of the Problem**

Upon examining the API response for sessions, it was clear that a generic list of attendees was provided. Each attendee's role was not explicitly labeled as 'student' or 'teacher,' which made it difficult to determine their specific roles within the session. This ambiguity posed a significant problem for generating accurate reports and analyses of session participation, attendance, and engagement metrics.

**Solution Implementation**

The `AttendeeRole` parameter played a critical role in identifying the attendees' roles within a session.

- **Parameter Identification: `AttendeeRole`**
  - This parameter contained values indicating the role of the attendee in the session.
- **Role Classification**
  - If the `AttendeeRole` was set to `participant`, it indicated that the attendee was a student. If the `AttendeeRole` had any other value, it denoted that the attendee was a teacher or faculty member.

**Wednesday-Thursday: Contract Analysis**

**Introduction**

The document outlines the policies and compensation framework for faculty members teaching online courses in Distance Learning Diploma programs. It emphasizes the standards and obligations that faculty members must adhere to while teaching, as well as the financial incentives provided for their efforts. The compensation structure is meticulously detailed, highlighting how payments are tied to the number of lectures delivered and recorded, attendance requirements, and additional activities such as tests and forums. This system ensures that both teaching quality and student engagement are maintained while also providing clear guidelines for faculty on how to qualify for full compensation.

**Analysis of the Contract**

1. **Teaching Commitment**
   - A faculty member must teach the online course for Distance Learning Diplomas according to approved standards.
2. **Financial Compensation**
   - Faculty members receive a fixed compensation of 15,000 Saudi Riyals per section for teaching an online course in Distance Learning Diplomas programs.
3. **Breakdown of Compensation**
   - **Teaching (Synchronous Learning)**
     - Lecture Recording: Compensation depends on the number of lectures taught and recorded on Blackboard within a semester.
     - Amount: 9,000 Riyals (60% of total) is allocated for teaching.
     - Lectures Required: Nine (9) lectures must be taught and recorded each semester.
     - Per Lecture Rate: Each lecture is valued at 1,000 Riyals.
     - Lecture Duration: Courses with 4 hours are scheduled for 80 minutes, and 5-hour courses for 100 minutes per lecture.
     - Attendance Requirement: No compensation if the faculty member misses more than five (5) lectures or teaches less than 60 minutes per lecture.
     - Class Size Impact: If a class has 20 students or fewer and is the only section, full compensation is paid. For multiple sections with 20 or fewer students, only 30% of the compensation is paid, amounting to 4,500 Riyals for nine (9) activities, including tests and forums.
     - Compensation Deduction: If no make-up lecture is given for a missed one, the corresponding amount is deducted.
     - Make

-up Lectures: Can be scheduled on Thursdays or within the same week.
     - Daily Lecture Limit: Only one lecture (regular or make-up) per course per day is counted.
